**ERC20 Token and Vault Contract**

This repository contains the smart contracts for an ERC20 token and a vault contract. The ERC20 token contract provides functionalities for creating and managing tokens following the ERC20 standard. The vault contract is designed to securely hold tokens and implement additional features like time-locked withdrawals, multi-signature control, or any custom logic as per the requirements.

### ERC20 Token Contract

**Overview:**
The ERC20 token contract is a standard implementation adhering to the Ethereum token standard ERC20. It provides basic functionalities for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Features:**
- Minting new tokens.
- Burning tokens.
- Transferring tokens between addresses.
- Approving third-party addresses to spend tokens on behalf of the token holder.
- Checking token balances.

**Usage:**
1. Deploy the ERC20 token contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Configure initial token supply and other parameters during deployment.
3. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or smart contracts to perform token transfers, approvals, and other operations.

### Vault Contract

**Overview:**
The vault contract is designed to securely store tokens and implement additional features like time-locked withdrawals, multi-signature control, or any custom logic required for managing token holdings.

**Features:**
- Secure storage of tokens.
- Time-locked withdrawals: Tokens can be locked for a specified period before they can be withdrawn.
- Multi-signature control: Requires multiple signatures to execute certain operations, enhancing security.
- Custom logic: Implement custom logic as per specific requirements, such as token vesting schedules or token distribution mechanisms.

**Usage:**
1. Deploy the vault contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Configure the contract parameters, such as time-lock duration, multi-signature requirements, or any custom logic required.
3. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts to deposit, withdraw, or manage tokens stored in the vault.
